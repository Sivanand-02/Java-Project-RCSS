This is a menu-driven system having methods for checking for available doctors, booking appointments with the doctors, viewing the 
appointments, and cancelling the appointments. The patient can check for available doctors and book their appointments based on their 
needs and specialization of the doctor (For eg. Dermatologist). The patient is then asked to enter the appointment date and time and if 
there is no other patient at the same time slot then the patient's appointment is booked. The patient can view their appointments and 
also cancel their appointment if they wish to do so.
